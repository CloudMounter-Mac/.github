## What is CloudMounter Mac?

CloudMounter Mac is a professional utility that integrates cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Amazon S3, and FTP/WebDAV servers as local disks on your macOS system. This allows you to access, edit, and manage remote files directly from Finder without taking up physical disk space.

The application uses strong encryption (AES-256) to protect your data during transfers and storage. It is fully compatible with both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3) and optimized for macOS Ventura, Sonoma, and newer versions.

With CloudMounter, you can stream media, open documents, and organize files as if they were stored locally—all while saving valuable SSD space. Its intuitive interface ensures that even non-technical users can easily connect and manage multiple cloud accounts securely.
